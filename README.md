How it Works ⚙️
Users register through register.html, and data is stored in data.json.
Users log in through homepage.html, and if credentials match, they are redirected to welcome.html.
Log out button sends users back to homepage.html.

✅ Use a real database instead of JSON storage
✅ Implement password hashing for security
